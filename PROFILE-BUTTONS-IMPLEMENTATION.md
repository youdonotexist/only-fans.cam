# Profile Buttons Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of conditional profile buttons in the OnlyFans application. The feature ensures that edit profile, change password, and logout buttons only appear when viewing your own profile, while a subscribe button appears when viewing other users' profiles.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Profile Ownership Detection
- Added the `useAuth` hook from AuthContext to access the current user data
- Created an `isOwnProfile` state variable to track if the viewed profile belongs to the current user
- Updated the user data fetching logic to determine profile ownership by comparing:
  - For profiles accessed via `/profile/me`: Always set as own profile
  - For profiles accessed via username: Compare username with current user's username
  - For profiles accessed via ID: Compare user ID with current user's ID

### 2. Conditional Rendering
- Modified the cover photo edit functionality to only be available on own profile
- Updated the profile image edit functionality to only be available on own profile
- Changed the profile action buttons section to conditionally render:
  - On own profile: Show Edit Profile, Change Password, and Logout buttons
  - On other profiles: Show Subscribe, Message, and Bookmark buttons

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- Removed redundant action buttons section that was previously at the bottom of the profile
- Consolidated all user interaction buttons into a single section
- Added proper icon for the Subscribe button

## Benefits
1. **Improved User Experience**: Users now have a clear understanding of which profiles they can edit
2. **Cleaner Interface**: The profile page shows only relevant actions based on the context
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All profile-related actions are grouped together in a single section

## Testing
A manual test script (`test-profile-buttons.js`) has been created to verify these changes. The script provides a checklist for ensuring:
- Own profile shows the correct edit buttons
- Other profiles show the subscribe button
- Cover photo and profile image editing is only available on own profile
- Edge cases are handled properly

## Future Considerations
- Implement actual subscription functionality when the Subscribe button is clicked
- Add notification preferences for subscribed profiles
- Consider adding more social interaction options for other users' profiles
