# Mobile Button Width Fix

## Issue
The Subscribe and Message buttons on other users' profile pages were too wide on mobile devices, causing layout issues and poor user experience.

## Solution
Modified the CSS for the mobile viewport (max-width: 768px) to set appropriate fixed widths for the buttons:

1. **Subscribe Button**:
   - Changed from `flex: 1` (which made it expand to fill available space) to:
   - `width: auto` and `max-width: 140px`
   - This ensures the button is wide enough to fit the icon and text but not excessively wide

2. **Message Button**:
   - Kept the existing padding
   - Added `width: auto` and `max-width: 120px`
   - This provides consistent sizing with the Subscribe button while being proportional to its content

## Benefits
1. **Improved Mobile Layout**: Buttons now have appropriate widths on mobile devices
2. **Consistent Appearance**: Both buttons maintain consistent sizing relative to their content
3. **Better User Experience**: The profile action area looks more polished and professional
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All button functionality remains intact with the improved styling

## Files Changed
- `/front-end/src/components/Profile.module.css`: Updated mobile media query styles for the buttons

## Testing
A manual test script (`test-mobile-button-width.js`) has been created to verify these changes. The script provides a checklist for ensuring:
- Buttons have appropriate widths on mobile devices
- Icons and text are properly displayed
- Buttons maintain proper appearance across different mobile viewport sizes
- Button functionality is preserved

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing responsive text sizing for very small screens
- Monitor user feedback on mobile button usability
- Consider adding touch feedback effects for mobile users
