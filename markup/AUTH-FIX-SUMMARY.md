# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue
When users login or register, their account appears to be created, but they are still prompted with the login modal when navigating to protected routes. However, if they refresh the page, they can access protected routes without issues.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the authentication flow in the frontend:

1. When a user logs in or registers, the token is stored in localStorage correctly.
2. However, the AuthContext state was not being updated directly after login/register.
3. The LoginModal component was using its own network functions to make API calls but wasn't updating the AuthContext state.
4. Only after a page refresh would the AuthContext useEffect hook run, check for the token in localStorage, and update the authentication state.

## Solution
The solution was to update the LoginModal component to properly update the AuthContext state after successful login/register:

1. Imported the useAuth hook in the LoginModal component to access the login function from AuthContext.
2. Renamed the imported network functions to avoid naming conflicts:
   - `login` → `apiLogin`
   - `register` → `apiRegister`
3. Updated the handleLoginSubmit and handleRegisterSubmit functions to:
   - Call the API functions as before
   - Store the token in localStorage
   - Fetch user data
   - Call the AuthContext login function with the user data to update the authentication state
   - Remove the page reload since it's no longer necessary

## Changes Made
1. Updated imports in LoginModal.js to include useAuth and rename network functions
2. Added the login function from useAuth to the component
3. Modified handleLoginSubmit to update the AuthContext state
4. Modified handleRegisterSubmit to update the AuthContext state
5. Removed unnecessary page reloads

## Testing
Created a test script (test-auth-fix.js) that:
1. Logs in with test credentials
2. Navigates to a protected route
3. Checks if the login modal appears (it shouldn't)
4. Navigates to another protected route
5. Checks if the login modal appears (it shouldn't)

## Benefits
- Users now remain logged in when navigating between protected routes
- No page refresh is required after login/register
- Improved user experience with seamless navigation
- More consistent authentication state management

## Technical Details
The key improvement is that we're now properly updating the application's global authentication state immediately after login/register, rather than relying on a page refresh to trigger the useEffect hook in AuthContext that checks for the token in localStorage.
