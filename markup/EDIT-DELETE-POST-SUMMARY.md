# Edit/Delete Post Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds the ability for users to edit and delete their own fan posts. The functionality is accessible through a menu (three dots) that appears in the top right corner of the fan post container, but only when the logged-in user is the author of the post.

- Implemented a dropdown menu with "Edit" and "Delete" options
- Added proper styling for the menu with hover effects and positioning

### 3. Edit Functionality
- Created an edit form UI with fields for title and description
- Pre-populated form fields with the current post data
- Implemented form validation (title is required)
- Added "Cancel" and "Save Changes" buttons
- Implemented handleUpdatePost function to save changes to the backend
- Added success/error messaging

### 4. Delete Functionality
- Added confirmation dialog before deletion
- Implemented handleDeletePost function to remove the post from the backend
- Added navigation back to home page after successful deletion
- Added success/error messaging

### 5. Styling
- Added CSS for the options menu, dropdown, and buttons
