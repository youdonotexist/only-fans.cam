# IP Address Tracking Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of IP address tracking for user logins in the OnlyFans application. The feature tracks and stores the IP addresses of users when they log in or register, providing an audit trail of account access for security purposes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Update
Added a new `user_logins` table to store login events with the following structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_logins (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  ip_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  login_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  login_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_agent TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
)
```

This table stores:
- User ID (linked to the users table)
- IP address of the client
- Timestamp of the login
- Login type (login or register)
- User agent string from the browser

### 2. IP Address Extraction Utility
Created a utility function `getClientIp` in `ipUtils.ts` that extracts the client's IP address from the request object, handling various scenarios:
- X-Forwarded-For header (common when behind a proxy)
- X-Real-IP header
- Direct socket connection

The function prioritizes proxy headers to ensure the correct client IP is captured even when the application is behind load balancers or proxies.

### 3. Login Tracking Service
Implemented a service in `loginTrackingService.ts` with two main functions:
- `logUserLogin`: Records a login event with the user's IP address
- `getUserLoginHistory`: Retrieves login history for a specific user

### 4. Authentication Routes Update
Modified the login and registration endpoints in `authRoutes.ts` to:
- Capture IP addresses when users log in or register
- Log these events to the database
- Continue with normal authentication flow even if logging fails

### 5. Login History Endpoint
Added a new endpoint `/api/auth/login-history` that:
- Requires authentication
- Returns the login history for the authenticated user
- Includes IP addresses, timestamps, and login types

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**: IP addresses are considered personal data in many jurisdictions. The application should:
   - Include IP address collection in the privacy policy
   - Implement appropriate data retention policies
   - Ensure IP addresses are protected with the same level of security as other personal data

2. **Access Control**: Login history is only accessible to the authenticated user or administrators.

3. **Error Handling**: The implementation gracefully handles logging failures to ensure the authentication process isn't disrupted if IP tracking encounters an error.

## Testing

A test script `test-ip-tracking.js` was created to verify:
- Login events are properly recorded with IP addresses
- Login history can be retrieved
- All required fields are present in the login records

## Future Improvements

1. **Admin Interface**: Develop an admin interface to view login history across all users.

2. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Implement algorithms to detect suspicious login patterns based on IP addresses.

3. **Geolocation**: Add geolocation data based on IP addresses to provide more context about login locations.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.

5. **Data Retention**: Add automatic purging of old login records to comply with data minimization principles.

## Conclusion

The IP address tracking implementation provides valuable security information without impacting the user experience. It creates an audit trail of account access that can be used to investigate suspicious activity and enhance the overall security posture of the application.
