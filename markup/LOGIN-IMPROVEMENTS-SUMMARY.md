# Login Modal and Registration Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Duplicate Account Registration
**Issue:** Users could create new accounts with existing emails/usernames, as there was no proper handling of duplicate registration attempts.

**Solution:**
- The backend already had proper validation in place with UNIQUE constraints on the username and email fields in the database schema.
- Improved the frontend error handling to display user-friendly error messages when attempting to register with an existing username or email.
- Added specific error message detection for duplicate account errors, showing a clear message to the user.

### 2. Login Modal Tab Display
**Issue:** The login modal showed both login/registration text without proper styling. It should only show "Login" when on registration view and "Register" when on login view.

**Solution:**
- Modified the tab container in the LoginModal component to conditionally render only the opposite tab option.
- When on the login view, only the "Register" tab is shown.
- When on the registration view, only the "Login" tab is shown.
- Added proper styling for the tab switcher with hover effects and clear positioning.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **LoginModal.js**
   - Updated the tab container to conditionally render only the opposite tab option
   - Improved error handling for duplicate account registration

2. **LoginModal.module.css**
   - Added styling for the new switchTab class
   - Positioned the tab at the top-right of the modal
   - Added hover effects and proper styling

### Testing

Created two test scripts to verify the improvements:

1. **test-duplicate-account.js**
   - Tests registration with duplicate email and username
   - Verifies that the backend properly prevents duplicate accounts

2. **test-login-modal-improvements.js**
   - Provides a checklist for manually testing the login modal UI improvements
   - Covers tab display, tab switching, form validation, duplicate account handling, and responsive design

## Benefits
