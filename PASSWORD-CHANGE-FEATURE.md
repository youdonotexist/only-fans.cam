# Password Change Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the password change feature for the OnlyFans application. The feature allows authenticated users to change their passwords securely.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation
- Added a new endpoint in `authRoutes.ts`: `POST /api/auth/change-password`
- The endpoint is protected with authentication middleware
- Password change requires:
  - Current password (for verification)
  - New password (minimum 6 characters)
- The implementation follows security best practices:
  - Verifies current password using bcrypt.compare
  - Generates a new salt for the new password
  - Hashes the new password with bcrypt before storing

### Frontend Implementation
- Added a new API function in `userApi.ts`: `changePassword()`
- Added a "Change Password" button to the user profile page
- Implemented a password change form with:
  - Current password field
  - New password field
  - Confirm password field
  - Form validation (password matching, minimum length)
  - Success/error messaging

## Password Storage Security
The application uses industry-standard security practices for password storage:
- Passwords are never stored in plaintext
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a unique salt for each user
- The bcrypt algorithm provides built-in salt generation and secure hashing
- Password verification is done by comparing hashes, not the actual passwords

## How to Test
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to your profile page (click on your avatar or username)
3. Click the "Change Password" button
4. Enter your current password
5. Enter a new password (minimum 6 characters)
6. Confirm your new password
7. Click "Change Password" to submit
8. You should see a success message if the password was changed successfully
9. Log out and log back in with your new password to verify the change

## Security Considerations
- The password change form is only accessible to authenticated users
- The current password must be verified before allowing a password change
- Password validation ensures minimum security requirements
- All communication is done over HTTPS to prevent interception
- Error messages are generic to prevent information leakage
