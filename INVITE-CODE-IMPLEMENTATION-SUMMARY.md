# Invite Code Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. Added `INVITE_CODE` environment variable with default value 'ONLYFANS2025'
2. Added validation middleware to require an invite code during registration
3. Added logic to validate the submitted invite code against the configured value

### Frontend Changes
1. Added an invite code field to the registration form in LoginModal.js
2. Updated form validation to require the invite code
3. Updated the registration API call to include the invite code
4. Updated the RegisterRequest TypeScript interface to include the inviteCode field

### Documentation
1. Created comprehensive documentation in INVITE-CODE-FEATURE.md
2. Added a test script (test-invite-code.js) to verify the functionality

## Deployment Requirements

The changes have been implemented locally but need to be deployed to take effect:

1. **Backend Deployment**:
   - Deploy the updated backend code to the production environment
   - Set the `INVITE_CODE` environment variable in the production environment if you want to use a custom code

2. **Frontend Deployment**:
   - Deploy the updated frontend code to the production environment

## Testing Results

Testing with the production API URL showed:
- Registration with a valid invite code works correctly
- Registration with an invalid invite code currently succeeds (should fail after backend deployment)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the backend changes**:
   - Push the changes to the backend repository
   - Ensure the deployment process includes setting the `INVITE_CODE` environment variable

2. **Verify after deployment**:
   - Run the test script again after deployment to confirm that invalid invite codes are rejected
   - Test the registration flow manually through the UI

3. **Monitor and adjust**:
   - Monitor user registrations to ensure the invite code system is working as expected
   - Adjust the invite code as needed for different user groups or marketing campaigns

## Conclusion

The invite code feature has been successfully implemented in the codebase. Once deployed, it will provide a way to control access to the OnlyFans application through registration. The feature is configurable through an environment variable, making it easy to change the invite code without modifying the code.
