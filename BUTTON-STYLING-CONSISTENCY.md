# Button Styling Consistency Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to ensure consistent button styling across the OnlyFans application. Specifically, the Subscribe and Message buttons on other users' profiles now use the same styling as the Edit Profile and Change Password buttons on the user's own profile.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Subscribe Button Updates
- Changed background from `var(--gradient-secondary)` to `var(--gradient-primary)` to match Edit Profile button
- Updated padding from `var(--space-sm) var(--space-xl)` to `var(--space-sm) var(--space-lg)` for consistency
- Added `display: inline-flex` and `align-items: center` for proper icon alignment
- Added `gap: var(--space-xs)` for consistent spacing between icon and text
- Added `:active` state styling for better interaction feedback

### 2. Message Button Updates
- Changed from transparent background with border to `var(--gradient-secondary)` gradient background
- Changed text color from `var(--foreground-dim)` to `white` for better contrast
- Removed border and added `box-shadow: var(--shadow-md)` for consistent elevation
- Changed font weight from `var(--font-medium)` to `var(--font-semibold)` to match other buttons
- Updated hover and active states to match other buttons
- Maintained `min-width: 120px` for proper sizing

### 3. Mobile-Specific Improvements
- Added `justify-content: center` to both buttons in mobile view
- Added mobile styling for Change Password button to match Edit Profile button
- Maintained appropriate max-width constraints for mobile screens

## Benefits
1. **Consistent User Experience**: All action buttons now have a consistent look and feel
2. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Primary actions (Edit Profile, Subscribe) use the primary gradient, while secondary actions (Change Password, Message) use the secondary gradient
3. **Better Accessibility**: Improved contrast ratios for text on buttons
4. **Enhanced Mobile Experience**: Consistent button styling and sizing on smaller screens

## Testing
The changes have been tested on both desktop and mobile views to ensure:
- Buttons maintain proper appearance across different screen sizes
- Icons and text are properly aligned
- Hover and active states work correctly
- Mobile-specific sizing constraints are maintained

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding more visual feedback for button interactions (like ripple effects)
- Implement consistent focus states for keyboard navigation
- Create a reusable button component to ensure styling consistency across the application
