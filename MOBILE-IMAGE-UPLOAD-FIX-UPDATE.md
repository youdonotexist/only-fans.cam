# Mobile Image Upload Fix Update

## Issue
Users were still reporting issues with image uploads during New Post creation. The previews weren't showing up and when the post was submitted, the images didn't appear. This was particularly problematic on mobile devices (Safari, Android browsers).

## Root Cause
Despite our previous fix to add the missing CSS classes for the upload button, the underlying issue with image handling persisted. The application was using `URL.createObjectURL()` to create preview URLs for selected images, which has inconsistent behavior across mobile browsers.

## Solution
We replaced `URL.createObjectURL()` with `FileReader.readAsDataURL()` for generating image previews. This approach is more compatible with mobile browsers and ensures that image previews are displayed correctly.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `handleFileSelect` function in HomeScreen.js**:
   - Replaced `URL.createObjectURL()` with `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
   - This ensures that image previews are generated in a way that's compatible with mobile browsers
   - Added proper error handling for the FileReader

2. **Updated `removeFile` function**:
   - Removed `URL.revokeObjectURL()` call since we're no longer using object URLs
   - Simplified the function to just remove the file and preview URL from state

3. **Updated form cancel button handler**:
   - Removed `URL.revokeObjectURL()` calls
   - Simplified to just reset state variables

4. **Updated form submission handler**:
   - Removed `URL.revokeObjectURL()` calls
   - Simplified to just reset state variables

## Testing
A test script (`test-image-upload-fix.js`) was created to verify the fix. The script provides a checklist for manually testing the image upload functionality on various mobile devices and browsers.

## Expected Results
- Image previews should now appear correctly on all mobile devices
- Images should be successfully uploaded and included in posts
- No memory leaks from unreleased object URLs
- The upload process should work consistently across different browsers and devices

## Comparison with FanDetails.js
The FanDetails.js component was previously working correctly for image uploads. We've now aligned the implementation in HomeScreen.js with the same approach, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding more robust error handling for image uploads
- Add file size and type validation to prevent issues with large or unsupported files
- Implement image compression to improve upload performance on mobile devices
- Add progress indicators for large file uploads
- Consider implementing a drag-and-drop interface for desktop users
