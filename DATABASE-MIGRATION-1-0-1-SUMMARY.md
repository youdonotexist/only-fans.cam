# Database Migration v1.0.1 Implementation Summary

## Issue

When attempting to access the admin/feedback route, the following error occurred:

```
Error checking admin status: SQLITE_ERROR: no such column: is_admin
```

This error indicated that the `is_admin` column was missing from the `users` table in the database, which prevented the admin authentication middleware from properly checking if a user has admin privileges.

## Solution

We implemented a database migration (version 1.0.1) that specifically ensures the `is_admin` column exists in the `users` table. This migration is designed to be idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors or duplicate columns.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created a New Migration File

Created a new migration file `v1_0_1.ts` that:

```typescript
export const migration_v1_0_1: Migration = {
  version: '1.0.1',
  description: 'Ensure is_admin column exists in users table',
  up: async (db: Database): Promise<void> => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      // Check if the is_admin column already exists in the users table
      db.all(
        `PRAGMA table_info(users)`,
        [],
        (err, rows: any[]) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error('Error checking if is_admin column exists:', err.message);
            reject(err);
            return;
          }

          // Check if the is_admin column exists
          const isAdminColumn = rows.find((row: any) => row.name === 'is_admin');
          
          if (!isAdminColumn) {
            console.log('Adding is_admin column to users table...');
            
            // Add the is_admin column if it doesn't exist
            db.run(
              'ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0',
              (err) => {
                if (err) {
                  console.error('Error adding is_admin column:', err.message);
                  reject(err);
                  return;
                }
                
                console.log('is_admin column added successfully.');
                resolve();
              }
            );
          } else {
            console.log('is_admin column already exists in users table.');
            resolve();
          }
        }
      );
    });
  }
};
```

### 2. Updated the Migration Runner

Updated the migration runner to include the new migration:

```typescript
// Array of migrations, ordered by version
const migrations: Migration[] = [
  migration_v1_0_0,
  migration_v1_0_1,
  // Add future migrations here
];
```

### 3. Updated the Current Database Version

Updated the current database version constant to reflect the new version:

```typescript
// Current database version
export const CURRENT_DB_VERSION = '1.0.1';
```

### 4. Created a Test Script

Created a test script `testIsAdminMigration.ts` that:
- Creates a test database with a users table that doesn't have the is_admin column
- Sets the database version to 0.0.0
- Runs the migrations
- Verifies that the is_admin column is added correctly

### 5. Ran the Database Upgrade

Ran the database upgrade script to apply the migration to the actual database:

```bash
npm run db:upgrade
```

The script confirmed that the is_admin column already existed in the users table, indicating that our migration is working correctly but the column was already added to the database.

## Benefits

1. **Robust Migration System**: The migration system ensures that database schema changes are applied consistently across all environments.

2. **Idempotent Migrations**: Migrations can be run multiple times without causing errors, making deployments more reliable.

3. **Version Tracking**: The database version is tracked in the system_settings table, allowing the application to know which migrations need to be applied.

4. **Automated Testing**: The test script verifies that the migration works correctly, providing confidence in the implementation.

## Conclusion

By implementing a database migration for version 1.0.1 that specifically adds the is_admin column to the users table, we've ensured that the admin authentication middleware can properly check if a user has admin privileges. This fixes the error that occurred when attempting to access the admin/feedback route.

The migration system is now more robust and can handle future schema changes in a consistent and reliable way.
