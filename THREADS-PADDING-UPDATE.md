# Threads Component Padding Update

## Issue Description
The horizontal padding on the threads component in the messages view needed to be reduced to exactly 10px to provide more space for content on mobile devices.

## Changes Made
Updated the horizontal padding in the MessageList.module.css file:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .conversationItem {
    padding: var(--space-sm) 10px; /* Horizontal padding reduced to exactly 10px */
  }
}
```

## Before/After Comparison
- **Before**: Horizontal padding was set to `var(--space-xs)` (a CSS variable)
- **After**: Horizontal padding is now exactly `10px`

## Benefits
1. **More Content Space**: Further reduced padding allows even more content to be displayed on mobile screens
2. **Better Readability**: Messages and conversation items can use more of the available screen width
3. **Improved User Experience**: Less wasted space makes the interface feel more optimized for mobile

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
- The conversation items have exactly 10px horizontal padding on mobile devices
- The content displays correctly with the new padding
- No layout issues are introduced by the change

## Manual Testing Instructions
To verify these changes:
1. Open the app on a mobile device or using browser's mobile emulation (width <= 768px)
2. Navigate to the messages page
3. Check that the conversation items (threads list) have exactly 10px horizontal padding
4. Verify that all content fits well and is properly aligned
