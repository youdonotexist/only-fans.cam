# Messages Page Threads View Fix

## Issue Description
The messages page was starting on the thread component (individual conversation) instead of the threads component (conversation list). This was particularly problematic on mobile devices where only one view can be shown at a time due to space constraints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Initial View State
- Modified the initial state of `showConversations` to always be `true` instead of being dependent on window width:
  ```javascript
  // Before:
  const [showConversations, setShowConversations] = useState(window.innerWidth > 768);
  
  // After:
  const [showConversations, setShowConversations] = useState(true);
  ```

### 2. URL Parameter Handling
- Removed code that was hiding the conversations panel on mobile when a URL parameter was present:
  ```javascript
  // Before:
  // On mobile, show the conversation detail
  if (window.innerWidth <= 768) {
    setShowConversations(false);
  }
  
  // After:
  // Always keep the conversations list visible by default
  // (removed code that was hiding conversations on mobile)
  ```

### 3. Conversation Selection Behavior
- Modified the `handleConversationSelect` function to keep the conversations panel visible even after selecting a conversation:
  ```javascript
  // Before:
  // On mobile, hide the conversations panel after selecting a conversation
  if (window.innerWidth <= 768) {
    setShowConversations(false);
  }
  
  // After:
  // Keep the conversations panel visible even after selecting a conversation
  // This ensures users can easily switch between conversations
  ```

## Benefits
1. **Improved User Experience**: Users now start with the threads list visible, providing better context and navigation options.
2. **Consistent Behavior**: The messages page behavior is now consistent across different entry points.
3. **Better Navigation**: Users can easily switch between conversations without losing context.
4. **Mobile Usability**: On mobile devices, users can still use the toggle button to switch between views as needed.

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
- The messages page always starts with the threads list visible
- The toggle button still works to switch between views on mobile
- Selecting a conversation doesn't automatically hide the threads list
- URL parameters for starting new conversations work correctly

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a setting to allow users to choose their preferred default view
- Implement a responsive layout that can show both panels side by side on larger screens
- Add visual indicators to show which conversation is currently selected
