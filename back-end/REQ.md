This project is called only-fans: a website for users to upload photos of their favorite fans (box fans, ceiling fans, industrial fans, desk fans, floor fans, old timey fans, etc) along with descriptions. This application will act similarly to only fans, but for content related to fans. 

I want you to build an express backend that manages registration, authentication, user accounts, CRUD operations for fans, followable user accounts, and upload of images and videos related to fans. 

Please use the following technologies:

javascript
nodejs
typescript
expressjs
docker
kubernetes
litestream
sqlite

Please start by building all the endpoint definitions, then by configuring the litestream cconnections. 
Then, write the docker and kubernetes scripts for deployment of the nodejs server, the sqlite server in AWS using docker and k8s
Please do all this work in the 'back-end' directory
