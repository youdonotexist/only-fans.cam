# Mobile Bottom Bar Scrollbar Fix

## Issue
The bottom bar in mobile view had a scrollbar appearing on the right side. According to the requirements, this bar should not be scrollable.

## Root Cause
The scrollbar was appearing because the `.sidebar` class had `overflow-y: auto` set in its base styles, which was being inherited in the mobile view. This property allows vertical scrolling when content exceeds the container height.

## Solution
Added `overflow-y: hidden` to the mobile-specific `.sidebar` styles to override the base style and prevent the scrollbar from appearing.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .sidebar {
        /* other properties... */
        overflow-y: hidden; /* Prevent scrollbar in mobile view */
    }
}
```

## Files Changed
- `/front-end/src/components/Sidebar.module.css`

## Testing
Created a test script (`test-mobile-bottom-bar-scrollbar.js`) with a checklist for manual testing to verify:
1. The scrollbar is no longer visible in the mobile bottom bar
2. The bottom bar remains fixed at the bottom of the screen
3. Navigation functionality works correctly
4. Content has proper padding to prevent being hidden behind the bottom bar

## Notes
- This change only affects the mobile view (screen width â‰¤ 768px)
- The desktop sidebar still has `overflow-y: auto` to allow scrolling when needed
- All main content areas (HomeScreen, FanDetails, Profile) already had proper padding to accommodate the bottom bar
