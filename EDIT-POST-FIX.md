# Edit Post Fix

## Issue
The edit post functionality was not launching from the home screen. When users clicked the "Edit Post" option in the post options menu, nothing happened except a console log message.

## Solution
Implemented the edit post functionality in the HomeScreen.js component to allow users to edit their posts directly from the home screen.

### Changes Made:

1. **Added state variables for editing mode**:
   - Added `isEditing` state to track if we're in edit mode
   - Added `editingFanId` to store the ID of the post being edited
   - Added `editTitle`, `editDescription`, and `editFanType` to store the edited values

2. **Imported the updateFan function**:
   - Added import for the `updateFan` function from fanApi.ts

3. **Implemented the edit post handler**:
   - Modified the edit post option in the post menu to set up editing state
   - Populated the form with the existing post data
   - Set the form to edit mode

4. **Updated the post form to handle both creating and editing**:
   - Modified the form title to show "Edit Fan Post" when in edit mode
   - Updated form inputs to use either new post or edit state values based on mode
   - Added conditional rendering for form elements

5. **Updated the form submission handler**:
   - Added logic to handle both creating new posts and updating existing ones
   - Added API call to update the post when in edit mode
   - Updated the local state to reflect changes immediately
   - Added appropriate success messages

6. **Updated the cancel button handler**:
   - Added logic to reset editing state when canceling
   - Ensured all state is properly cleaned up

## Testing
A test script (`test-edit-post.js`) was created to verify the fix. The script provides a checklist for manually testing the edit post functionality.

## Expected Results
- Users can now edit their posts directly from the home screen
- The edit form is pre-populated with the post's current data
- Changes are saved when the form is submitted
- The post is immediately updated in the UI after editing
- Success message appears after successful edit
- Form validation works correctly (title is required)

## Future Considerations
- Add ability to edit post images
- Add confirmation dialog before discarding changes
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (save, cancel)
- Consider adding a draft mode for posts
