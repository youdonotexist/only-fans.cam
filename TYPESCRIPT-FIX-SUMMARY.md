# TypeScript Error Fix Summary

## Issue

The build process was failing with the following TypeScript errors:

```
src/database/migrations/index.ts(62,56): error TS2339: Property 'value' does not exist on type '{}'.
src/database/migrations/index.ts(87,21): error TS2339: Property 'value' does not exist on type '{}'.
src/scripts/upgradeDatabase.ts(26,28): error TS18046: 'rows' is of type 'unknown'.
```

## Root Cause

The errors were related to missing type annotations in the SQLite database callback functions:

1. In `migrations/index.ts`, the `row` parameter in database callbacks was not properly typed, causing TypeScript to infer it as an empty object type `{}`, which doesn't have a `value` property.

2. In `upgradeDatabase.ts`, the `rows` parameter was inferred as `unknown`, which doesn't have a `find` method that was being called on it.

## Solution

The fix involved adding proper type annotations to the callback parameters:

1. In `migrations/index.ts`, added type annotations for the `row` parameter in two places:

```typescript
// In initializeVersionTracking function
db.get('SELECT value FROM system_settings WHERE key = ?', [DB_VERSION_KEY], 
  (err, row: { value: string } | undefined) => {
    // Function body
  }
);

// In getDatabaseVersion function
db.get('SELECT value FROM system_settings WHERE key = ?', [DB_VERSION_KEY], 
  (err, row: { value: string } | undefined) => {
    // Function body
  }
);
```

2. In `upgradeDatabase.ts`, added a type annotation for the `rows` parameter:

```typescript
db.get(
  `PRAGMA table_info(${table})`,
  [],
  (err, rows: any) => {
    // Function body
  }
);
```

## Testing

The fixes were tested by running the build process:

```
npm run build
```

The build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors, confirming that the issues have been resolved.

## Best Practices

For future SQLite database operations, it's recommended to:

1. Define proper interfaces for database results to avoid type errors
2. Use explicit type annotations for callback parameters
3. Consider using a more type-safe database library or wrapper

By following these practices, we can prevent similar TypeScript errors in the future and improve the overall type safety of the codebase.
