# Mobile Bottom Bar Icon Heights Fix

## Issue
The icons in the mobile bottom bar had inconsistent heights, which affected the visual alignment and overall appearance of the navigation.

## Root Cause
In the mobile view, navigation icons (Home, Notifications, Messages) were using SVG elements with `font-size: 1.5em` without a fixed height, while the user avatar had fixed dimensions of `30px Ã— 30px`.

## Solution
Modified the SVG styling in the mobile view to match the user avatar dimensions by adding:
- Fixed height and width of 30px to all SVG icons
- Display flex with centered alignment to ensure proper positioning

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    svg {
        margin-right: 0;
        font-size: 1.5em;
        height: 30px; /* Match height with user avatar */
        width: 30px; /* Match width with user avatar */
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
    }
}
```

## Files Changed
- `/front-end/src/components/Sidebar.module.css`

## Testing
Created a test script (`test-mobile-icon-heights.js`) with a checklist for manual testing to verify:
1. All navigation icons have the same height (30px)
2. User profile avatar has the same height as navigation icons (30px)
3. All icons are properly aligned vertically in the bottom bar
4. Icons maintain their aspect ratio and are not distorted
5. Navigation functionality works correctly after the changes

## Benefits
- Improved visual consistency in the mobile bottom bar
- Better alignment of navigation elements
- More professional appearance of the mobile interface
