# Mobile Image Upload Fix

## Issue
Users on mobile devices (Safari, Android browsers) were experiencing issues with image uploads in the create post form. Images would appear to be uploading, but the preview wouldn't show up and posting wouldn't result in a photo being included in the post.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to how image previews were being generated. The application was using `URL.createObjectURL()` to create preview URLs for selected images, which has inconsistent behavior across mobile browsers.

## Solution
We replaced `URL.createObjectURL()` with `FileReader.readAsDataURL()` for generating image previews. This approach is more compatible with mobile browsers and ensures that image previews are displayed correctly.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `handleFileSelect` function**:
   - Replaced `URL.createObjectURL()` with `FileReader.readAsDataURL()`
   - This ensures that image previews are generated in a way that's compatible with mobile browsers

2. **Updated `removeFile` function**:
   - Removed `URL.revokeObjectURL()` call since we're no longer using object URLs
   - Simplified the function to just remove the file and preview URL from state

3. **Updated form cancel button handler**:
   - Removed `URL.revokeObjectURL()` calls
   - Simplified to just reset state variables

4. **Updated form submission handler**:
   - Removed `URL.revokeObjectURL()` calls
   - Simplified to just reset state variables

## Testing
A test script (`test-mobile-image-upload.js`) was created to verify the fix. The script provides a checklist for manually testing the image upload functionality on various mobile devices and browsers.

## Expected Results
- Image previews should now appear correctly on all mobile devices
- Images should be successfully uploaded and included in posts
- No memory leaks from unreleased object URLs

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding more robust error handling for image uploads
- Add file size and type validation to prevent issues with large or unsupported files
- Implement image compression to improve upload performance on mobile devices
