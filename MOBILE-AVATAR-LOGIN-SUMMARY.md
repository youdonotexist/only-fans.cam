# Mobile Avatar and Login Button Implementation

## Overview
This implementation addresses two key requirements:
1. Moving the logged-in avatar icon in the mobile bottom bar to be inside the same flex layout as the home, notification, and messages icons
2. Adding login functionality to the sidebar when not logged in, in both desktop and mobile views

## Changes Made

### 1. Avatar Positioning in Mobile View
- Moved the user avatar from being a separate element outside the navigation to being part of the navigation list
- Created a separate user profile element for desktop view that appears at the bottom of the sidebar
- Added CSS to hide/show the appropriate elements based on screen size
- Ensured the avatar has the same size (30px Ã— 30px) as other navigation icons in mobile view

### 2. Login Button Integration
- Added the LoginButton component to the sidebar for non-logged-in users
- Created two instances of the login button:
  - One inside the navigation list (for mobile view)
  - One at the bottom of the sidebar (for desktop view)
- Added CSS to hide/show the appropriate login button based on screen size
- Styled the mobile login button to match other navigation icons (circular, icon-only)

## Files Modified

1. **Sidebar.js**
   - Imported the LoginButton component
   - Added the user avatar to the navigation list for mobile view
   - Added the login button to both the navigation list and bottom of sidebar
   - Maintained the desktop user profile at the bottom of the sidebar

2. **Sidebar.module.css**
   - Added styles for the user profile in both desktop and mobile views
   - Added styles for the login button in both desktop and mobile views
   - Added media queries to control visibility based on screen size
   - Ensured consistent sizing and spacing of all elements

## Testing
Created a comprehensive test script (`test-mobile-avatar-login.js`) with a checklist for manual testing to verify:
- Avatar and login button appearance in both desktop and mobile views
- Proper positioning and styling of all elements
- Correct functionality (navigation, login/logout)
- Responsive behavior when resizing the browser

## Benefits
- Improved mobile UI consistency with all navigation elements in the same flex layout
- Better user experience for non-logged-in users with easy access to login functionality
- Consistent styling across all navigation elements
- Proper responsive behavior between desktop and mobile views
